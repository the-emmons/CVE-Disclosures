# CVE-2022-29152
## Description
The Ericom PowerTerm WebConnect login portal unsafely writes values from the 'AppPortal' cookie into the page source, permitting arbitrary Javascript execution.

## Impact
Portal credentials can be captured via cross-site scripting.

## Exploitability
To persist the login form fields, the Ericom portal sets the 'AppPortal' cookie and populates it with POST data from the last failed login attempt. Because of that behavior, a malicious cookie can be set from an attacker-controlled domain using cross-site request forgery to submit a failed login attempt. If a victim views an attacker's webpage a single time, an attacker can trigger an exploit chain that may result in the theft of Active Directory credentials.
